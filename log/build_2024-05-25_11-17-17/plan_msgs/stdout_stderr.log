[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmessage_generation.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "message_generation", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "message_generation" with any of the following names:

    message_generationConfig.cmake
    message_generation-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "message_generation" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "message_generation_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "message_generation" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
